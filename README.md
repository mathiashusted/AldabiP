## About
This repository contains the code implementations for the Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics Practical course at [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). The main focus is on implementing various algorithms using C++. Each algorithm is implemented as a final assignment, organized in a structured way for easy navigation and comprehension.


## Course Structure
The course is divided into 2 modules running in parallel:
1. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics
2. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics Practical

In the first, we will acquire a theoretical understanding of the algorithms and data structures used. In the latter, we will have a go ourselves in groups of 2 at implementing them in an efficient manner - this is the code you will find in our repository. These will undergo exhaustive testing to ensure proper performance.


### Topics
- Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm (including wildcard capability)
- Suffix arrays
- Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (+ Smith-Waterman)
- BLAST (Partially)
- Q-Gram-Index (Implementation using Counting Sort for SA Construction)
- Aho-Corasick algorithm
- Pushdown Automata (for hairpin detection)


## Implementations
Each final assignment corresponding to a task is placed in a folder named `aufgabe1`, `aufgabe2`, etc., where `aufgabe` means task in German. For instance, the implementation for the first task will be found under the `aufgabe1` folder.

The real development for each of these assignments takes place under `src/*` directory. For example, the code for the first task would be under `src/a1_dzima/*` and `src/a1_mathias/*`. Additionally, you will also see the templates we were given. All of the tasks are numbered chronologically and will get progressively more complex.

As a general rule, each program fundamentally consists of minimum 3 files:
- aufgabeX.h
- aufgabeX.cpp
- aufgabeX_main.cpp

Our main work will be done inside the second, where we will implement the functions given to us in the header file by the [instructors](#instructors).

## Testing
Each assignment folder contains a test file named `a*_test.cpp.` To run the tests, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic -O3 aufgabe1.cpp aufgabe1_test.cpp -o aufgabe1_test

```
This command will compile the test file using the C++17 standard, apply all warnings (`-Wall`), enforce strict compliance to the C++ standard (`-pedantic`), and optimize the code (`-O3`). It will then generate an executable file named `aufgabe1_test`.


Alternatively, you can use the provided `Makefile` to compile the test file. To do so, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the following command:
```bash
make
```


## Installation
To get started with the development, clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Aldabe-Praktikum.git
```
After cloning, navigate to the project's root directory and follow the instructions specific to each task under the [Implementations](#installation) section.


## Continuous Integration
This repository utilizes GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI pipeline automatically triggers every time a new commit is pushed to the repository. It compiles and runs the tests as specified, ensuring that each change to the codebase maintains the integrity of the algorithms implemented.
