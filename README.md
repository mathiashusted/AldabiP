## About
In our university course "Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics", we get a grasp on the fundamental algorithms and data structures used in bioinformatics and implement them using C++. In this repository, you will find our code.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into 2 modules running in parallel:
1. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics
2. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics Practical

In the first, we will acquire a theoretical understanding of the algorithms and data structures used. In the latter, we will have a go ourselves in groups of 2 at implementing them in an efficient manner - this is the code you will find in our repository. These will undergo exhaustive testing to ensure proper performance.

## Implementations
- Exact string matching (e.g. Boyer-Moore algorithm)
- Sequence alignment
- ...

Each directory contains specific information to help you understand the code's functionality.

## Installation
TBD
