## About
This repository contains the code implementations for the Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics Practical course at [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). The main focus is on implementing various algorithms using C++. Each algorithm is implemented as a final assignment, organized in a structured way for easy navigation and comprehension.


## Course Structure
The course is divided into 2 modules running in parallel:
1. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics
2. Algorithms and Data Structures for Bioinformatics Practical

In the first, we will acquire a theoretical understanding of the algorithms and data structures used. In the latter, we will have a go ourselves in groups of 2 at implementing them in an efficient manner - this is the code you will find in our repository. These will undergo exhaustive testing to ensure proper performance.


### Topics
- Exact string matching - [(e.g. Boyer-Moore algorithm)]
- Theme 2 - [Description]
- Theme 3 - [Description]
...
[More themes will be added as the course progresses]


## Implementations
Each final assignment corresponding to a theme is placed in a folder named `aufgabe1`, `aufgabe2`, etc., where `aufgabe` means task in German. For instance, for the first theme, you will find the implementation inside the `aufgabe1` folder.

The real development for each of these assignments takes place under `src/*` directory. For example, the code for the first theme would be under `src/a1_dzima/*` and `src/a1_mathias/*`.


## Testing
Each assignment folder contains a test file named `a*_test.cpp.` To run the tests, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic -O3 aufgabe1.cpp aufgabe1_test.cpp -o aufgabe1_test

```
This command will compile the test file using the C++17 standard, apply all warnings (`-Wall`), enforce strict compliance to the C++ standard (`-pedantic`), and optimize the code (`-O3`). It will then generate an executable file named `aufgabe1_test`.



## Installation
To get started with the development, clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Aldabe-Praktikum.git
```
After cloning, navigate to the project's root directory and follow the instructions specific to each task under the [Implementations](#installation) section.


## Continuous Integration
This repository utilizes GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI pipeline automatically triggers every time a new commit is pushed to the repository. It compiles and runs the tests as specified, ensuring that each change to the codebase maintains the integrity of the algorithms implemented.
